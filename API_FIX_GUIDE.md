# 🔧 Fix Applied: Real TMDB API Data Now Working!

## What Was Wrong?

The [`http-client.ts`](c:\Users\job\Documents\react-native\react-native-movie-app\services\api\http-client.ts) file had **two issues**:

### Issue 1: Hardcoded API Key ❌
```typescript
// OLD CODE (Wrong)
const API_KEY = "fd6254a194e5a064e27a9f3d730fe4f7";
```

The API key was hardcoded instead of reading from your `.env` file.

### Issue 2: Wrong Validation Logic ❌
```typescript
// OLD CODE (Wrong)
const isApiKeyConfigured = API_KEY && API_KEY !== 'fd6254a194e5a064e27a9f3d730fe4f7';
```

It was checking if the API key is **NOT** equal to `'fd6254a194e5a064e27a9f3d730fe4f7'`, but that's exactly YOUR API key! So it always thought the API was not configured.

## What Was Fixed?

### ✅ Now Reads from Environment Variable
```typescript
// NEW CODE (Correct)
const API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY || '';
```

### ✅ Proper Validation Logic
```typescript
// NEW CODE (Correct)
const isApiKeyConfigured = API_KEY && API_KEY !== 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' && API_KEY.length > 20;
```

Now it checks for a valid API key (not placeholder and length > 20 chars).

## 🚀 How to Enable Real API Data

You have **2 options**:

### Option 1: Already Have the API Key in .env (Quickest)

Your `.env` file already has the key! Just restart the server:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart with cache clear
npx expo start --clear
```

**That's it!** You should now see:
```
✅ TMDB API Key configured - Using real API data!
🌐 Fetching from TMDB: /tv/popular
```

---

### Option 2: Use a Different API Key

If you want to use your own TMDB API key:

1. **Get a TMDB API key** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
   - Request an API key (free)

2. **Update the `.env` file:**
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart Expo:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

---

## 🧪 How to Verify It's Working

### Check Console Logs

When the app loads, you should see:
```
✅ TMDB API Key configured - Using real API data!
🌐 Fetching from TMDB: /tv/airing_today
🌐 Fetching from TMDB: /tv/94605
🌐 Fetching from TMDB: /tv/94605/season/1
```

**NOT** this (which means mock data):
```
🎭 Using mock data for: /tv/popular
```

### Visual Confirmation

- **Real Data**: You'll see current TV shows and movies from TMDB
- **Mock Data**: You'll see the same test shows (The Bachelor, RuPaul's Drag Race, etc.)

## 📊 What Changed in the Code

**File Modified:** [`services/api/http-client.ts`](c:\Users\job\Documents\react-native\react-native-movie-app\services\api\http-client.ts)

**Before:**
```typescript
const API_KEY = "fd6254a194e5a064e27a9f3d730fe4f7";  // Hardcoded
const isApiKeyConfigured = API_KEY && API_KEY !== 'fd6254a194e5a064e27a9f3d730fe4f7';  // Wrong logic
```

**After:**
```typescript
const API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY || '';  // From .env
const isApiKeyConfigured = API_KEY && API_KEY !== 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' && API_KEY.length > 20;  // Correct logic
```

---

## 🎉 Ready to Go!

Just restart your Expo server and you'll get **real, live data** from TMDB! 🚀

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

Then open your app and browse real movies and TV shows! 🎬📺
