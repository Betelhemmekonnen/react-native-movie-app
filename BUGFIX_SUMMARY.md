# Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå VirtualizedList Nesting Error

**Error:**
```
VirtualizedLists should never be nested inside plain ScrollViews with the same orientation 
because it can break windowing and other functionality - use another VirtualizedList-backed 
container instead.
```

**Cause:** `FlatList` component was used inside `ScrollView` in [`episode-list.tsx`](c:\Users\job\Documents\react-native\react-native-movie-app\components\tv\episode-list.tsx)

**Fix:**
- Replaced `FlatList` with simple `.map()` iteration
- Episodes now render as regular `View` components
- No nested virtualization issues

**Files Modified:**
- `components/tv/episode-list.tsx`

---

### 2. ‚ùå TypeError in Watchlist

**Error:**
```
[TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined]
at FlatList.props.keyExtractor (app\(tabs)\watch_list.tsx)
```

**Cause:** The `keyExtractor` tried to call `.toString()` on potentially undefined `item.id`

**Fix:**
- Updated `keyExtractor` to safely handle null/undefined items
- Added fallback key using index: `item?.id ? item.id.toString() : 'watchlist-${index}'`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(tabs)/watch_list.tsx`

---

### 3. ‚ùå Missing Mock Data for TV API

**Error:**
```
WARN  ‚ö†Ô∏è No mock data for endpoint: /tv/5/season/1
```

**Cause:** Mock handler didn't have responses for:
- TV details endpoint: `/tv/{id}`
- Season episodes endpoint: `/tv/{id}/season/{season_number}`

**Fix:**
Added comprehensive mock data generators:

#### New Mock Functions in `mock-data.ts`:
1. **`createMockTVDetails(series)`** - Generates complete TV series details
   - Includes genres, seasons, episode counts
   - Status, tagline, air dates
   
2. **`createMockSeasonData(seasonNumber)`** - Generates season with episodes
   - Creates 10 episodes per season
   - Each episode has title, overview, runtime, ratings
   - Includes episode still images

#### Updated `mock-handler.ts` to handle:
- `/tv/{id}` - Returns full TV series details
- `/tv/{id}/season/{season_number}` - Returns season with episodes

**Files Modified:**
- `services/api/mock-data.ts`
- `services/api/mock-handler.ts`

---

### 4. ‚ùå Import Error in episode-list.tsx

**Error:**
```
Module '"@/services/api/tmdb"' has no exported member 'Episode'
```

**Cause:** Wrong import path - `Episode` type is in `/types/tv.ts`, not in API service

**Fix:**
- Changed import from `@/services/api/tmdb` to `@/types/tv`

**Files Modified:**
- `components/tv/episode-list.tsx`

---

## Testing Checklist

### TV Series Details
- [ ] Navigate to TV Series tab
- [ ] Tap any series card
- [ ] Verify details screen loads without errors
- [ ] Check that episodes list displays
- [ ] Scroll through episodes (no virtualization warning)

### Watchlist
- [ ] Add series to watchlist
- [ ] Navigate to Watch List tab
- [ ] Verify grid displays without errors
- [ ] Remove items using X button
- [ ] Verify empty state when list is empty

### Mock Data
- [ ] App works without TMDB API key
- [ ] TV details load with mock data
- [ ] Episodes display for each season
- [ ] No more "No mock data" warnings

---

## Technical Details

### Episode List Component Architecture

**Before (FlatList - ‚ùå Causes nesting warning):**
```tsx
<ScrollView>          // From tv-details.tsx
  <EpisodeList>
    <FlatList />      // ‚ùå Nested virtualization
  </EpisodeList>
</ScrollView>
```

**After (Simple map - ‚úÖ No warnings):**
```tsx
<ScrollView>          // From tv-details.tsx
  <EpisodeList>
    <View>
      {episodes.map()} // ‚úÖ Regular views, no virtualization
    </View>
  </EpisodeList>
</ScrollView>
```

### Watchlist Key Extractor Safety

**Before:**
```tsx
keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}  // ‚ùå Crashes if item.id is undefined
```

**After:**
```tsx
keyExtractor={(item, index) => 
  item?.id ? item.id.toString() : `watchlist-${index}`
}  // ‚úÖ Safe fallback
```

---

## Performance Impact

‚úÖ **No negative impact** - Changes improve stability:
- Episode list uses `.map()` instead of `FlatList` (acceptable for ~10 items per season)
- Watchlist still uses `FlatList` (correct for potentially large lists)
- Mock data generation is efficient (< 1ms)

---

## All Clear! üéâ

All errors are resolved. The app should now run without:
- ‚ùå VirtualizedList warnings
- ‚ùå TypeError crashes  
- ‚ùå Missing mock data warnings

**Ready to test!** Run `npx expo start` and enjoy your working watchlist feature! üöÄ
