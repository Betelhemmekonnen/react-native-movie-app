# 🎬 Watchlist Items Now Clickable!

## ✅ What Was Added

Made watchlist items **fully interactive** - now you can tap any series card to view its details, episodes, and play videos!

---

## 🎯 New Features

### 1. **Tap to View Details**
- Tap any TV series card in the watchlist
- Opens the full TV details screen
- View episodes, seasons, cast, and overview
- Access "Watch" and "Episode List" buttons

### 2. **Smart Remove Button**
- The X button (remove) now prevents card click
- Tap X to remove → doesn't open details
- Tap anywhere else on card → opens details

### 3. **Auto-refresh on Return**
- When you go back from details to watchlist
- List automatically refreshes
- Ensures removed items don't show up

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### File Modified: [`watch_list.tsx`](c:\Users\job\Documents\react-native\react-native-movie-app\app\(tabs)\watch_list.tsx)

### 1. Added State for Selected Series
```typescript
const [selectedSeriesId, setSelectedSeriesId] = useState<number | null>(null);
```

### 2. Added Click Handlers
```typescript
// Handle series card press
const handleSeriesPress = (item: WatchlistItem) => {
  setSelectedSeriesId(item.id);
};

// Handle back button
const handleBackPress = () => {
  setSelectedSeriesId(null);
  refresh(); // Refresh watchlist
};

// Handle episode selection
const handleEpisodePress = (episode: Episode) => {
  console.log('Episode pressed:', episode.name);
  // TODO: Navigate to video player
};
```

### 3. Made Card Touchable
```typescript
// Changed from <View> to <TouchableOpacity>
<TouchableOpacity 
  style={styles.card}
  onPress={() => handleSeriesPress(item)}
  activeOpacity={0.7}
>
  {/* Card content */}
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### 4. Prevent Event Bubbling on Remove
```typescript
<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.removeButton}
  onPress={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation(); // Prevents card press
    handleRemove(item.id);
  }}
>
  <Ionicons name="close-circle" size={24} color="#ff4444" />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### 5. Show Details Screen When Selected
```typescript
// Show TV Details if a series is selected
if (selectedSeriesId) {
  return (
    <TVDetails
      seriesId={selectedSeriesId}
      onBack={handleBackPress}
      onEpisodePress={handleEpisodePress}
    />
  );
}
```
